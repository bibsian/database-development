Population Dynamics Database
============================

The goal of this project is to develop an open source database that wil contain raw aggregated information from numerous ecological studies on population dynamics (plants, animals, algae, etc). This database will *not* be up to third normal form standards. This is because we wish to have a centralized data repositary where all temporal and spatial replication within the data is preserved; this will allow for more accurate modeling of population dyanimcs through state-space models.

# Project Components
## Identifying Data Sources
 This information will not be made public until the completion of the project

## Database Schema
 See Schema folder.
 
 Using PostgreSQL 9.4.

## Populating the Database
  1) Data transfer Protocal: This protocol is directly tied to the GUI development. 
  
  2) GUI Development: PyQt 4.8 and Python 3.4
  
  3) UML Design Layout: To do
  
## Web Application to Access Database
  1) To be continued
